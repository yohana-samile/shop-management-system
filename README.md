                  INSTRUCTRIONS

Develop an information system to manage a medium sized supermarket. The system should have the following
features :

Should enable the system administrator (could be the manager or owner) to add into the database the
categories of products available (e.g. food, soft beverages, alcoholic beverages, home appliances, etc.)

Should enable the system administrator to dynamically define and modify various units of products
(Kilograms, litres, etc.)

Should enable the system administrator to register various categories of staff working at the
supermarket (cashier, aid, owner, manager, etc.)

Should enable the registration of staff employed at the supermarket. These should be assigned to the
registered categories, that are dynamically populated from the database. Also, during the registration,
their passport-size photos are required.

Should enable the manager to register the actual products that are available at the supermarket. These
should be grouped according to the categories in (i), which are dynamically populated from the
database. By default, during registration, the stock of each product should be set to one, and their units,
which are dynamically selected from the database, defined (e.g 1 Kg, 1L, etc.).

Should enable only the manager, owner, and storekeepers to get an actual stock of each product
available at the supermarket at any time. This should be downloadable in an MS Excel file format.

Should enable only the manager, owner, and storekeepers to update the stock of any of the product.
This should be through uploading an MS Excel file defining the product(s) and the new quantity to be
added.

Should enable the only the manager and cashiers to sell products. This should be through adding the
product(s) to be sold and their corresponding quantities required to cart. As the products are added to
cart, and the corresponding quantity defined, the total price per product, and the grand total should be
automatically computed.

After each sale, the system should generate a simple receipt in PDF format, which should be issued to
the customer. The system should also update the stock of each of the product sold.

The systems should enable the owner and the manager to see various reports, such as, the number of all
the staff (categories according to roles, gender, etc); daily sales; etc.
